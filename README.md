# CodeAlpha_IrisFlowerClassification

# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification - CodeAlpha Internship  

This project is part of my **CodeAlpha Internship**.  
The goal is to classify iris flowers into three species (**Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica**) based on their features.  

## 📊 Dataset
- Dataset used: **Iris Dataset**  
- Features: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width  
- Target: Species  

## ⚙️ Steps
1. Data Cleaning & Exploration (pandas)  
2. Data Visualization (matplotlib, seaborn)  
3. Train/Test Split  
4. Model Training using **Decision Tree Classifier**  
5. Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Classification Report, Confusion Matrix)  
6. Visualization of the Decision Tree & Decision Boundaries  

## 📂 Files
- `Iris_Classification.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook with code  
- `Iris_Classification.html` → Exported notebook for easy viewing  

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

## ✅ Results
- High accuracy achieved on test data  
- Petal Length & Petal Width were found to be the most important features  
- Visualization confirmed clear separation between classes
